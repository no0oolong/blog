    "After you train a machine learning model, the next thing to do is showcase it to the world by making a demo. Currently, the easiest way to do so if with Gradio, hosting on HuggingFace Spaces. With the Gradio framework deployed on Spaces, it takes <10 minutes to deploy a model! Let's see how we can easily deploy a model for the world to try out with these platforms. We will use a classic CNN pet classifier as an example.\n",

    "Now that we have our self-contained web app, we could deploy this on any  webserver or cloud platform that we want. But let's see how we can use HuggingFace Spaces to deploy it.\n",

    "# Using HuggingFace Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "[HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) is a free-to-use platform for hosting machine learning demos and apps. The Spaces environment provided is a CPU environment with 16 GB RAM and 8 cores. It currently supports the Gradio and Streamlit platforms. Here we will make a Space for our Gradio demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to create a HuggingFace Space, you need to have a HuggingFace account. You can sign up for free [here](https://huggingface.co/join). After signing up, you can create a Space by clicking \"New Space\" on the navigation menu (press on your profile image).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](create_spaces.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will be shown instructions on how to add your code to this Space from the command line to prepare the demo. Spaces are essentially git repositories (like GitHub) with an `app.py` file from which the demo is prepared. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we can clone the repository to a local directory, \n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/tmabraham/fastai_pet_classifier\n",
    "```\n",
    "add the `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `export.pkl`, and `siamese.jpg` files,\n",
    "```\n",
    "cp app.py fastai_pet_classifier/app.py\n",
    "cp requirements.txt fastai_pet_classifier/requirements.txt\n",
    "cp export.pkl fastai_pet_classifier/export.pkl\n",
    "cp siamese.jpg fastai_pet_classifier/siamese.jpg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before we commit our files, there is something we need to pay attention to. Our model file `export.pkl` is too big to be handled by `git`. So instead we need to use git-lfs. You will need to install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com) and then initialize git-lfs in the repository for the app in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git lfs install\n",
    "git lfs track \"*.pkl\"\n",
    "git add .gitattributes\n",
    "git commit -m \"update .gitattributes so git lfs will track .pkl files\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can commit and push the changes to the Space.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -am \"let's deploy to huggingface spaces\"\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatively**, the files can be uploaded via the Spaces UI. When you go to your Space, under \"Files and versions\", there is an \"Add files\" button which you can use to upload your app files.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a few moments, during which the app is being built, our demo should show up on the HuggingFace Space. [Here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tmabraham/fastai_pet_classifier) is mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! In a few minutes, you trained a pet classifier model with fastai, made a demo interface with Gradio, and hosted it for free on a HuggingFace Space! \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, check the relevant docs. There are so many features of Gradio and Spaces that I haven't mentioned here (like API support{% fn 2 %}, multiple models per demo, etc.). Additionally, both Gradio and HuggingFace Spaces are in active development that I bet this post will be out-of-date in a few weeks as it will be missing some of the new, amazing features the Gradio and HuggingFace teams add. For this reason, I also recommend following [HuggingFace](https://twitter.com/huggingface) and [Gradio](https://twitter.com/gradio) on Twitter to hear about the latest updates and newest features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll end by sharing a quick example prediction by my pet classifier of our kitten!:\n",
